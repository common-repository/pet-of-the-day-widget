Display an Adopt-a-Pet.com pet of the day for a US zip code in a widget.

== Description ==

**NO LONGER SUPPORTED**: This plugin is no longer actively maintained or supported, and may be closed soon. [Read the announcement](https://tech.chrishardie.com/2022/ending-support-wordpress-plugins/).

This plugin creates a widget to display an adoptable "pet of the day" for a given US or Canadian postal code, powered by Adopt-a-Pet.com.

When a user clicks on the pet image or the details button, they'll be taken to that pet's profile on Adopt-a-Pet.com in a new browser window or tab.

Use this plugin to encourage local pet adoption and adoptable pet awareness on your WordPress site.

Note that the plugin loads content from a third-party site via iframe, and so may introduce cookies, tracking codes, etc. in addition to those present on your WordPress site. This plugin and widget is in no way affiliated with or endorsed by Adopt-a-Pet.com or its partners.
